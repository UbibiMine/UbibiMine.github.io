            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <h4>You can call me <span>JAM </span> </h4>
            <p>I'm a second-year college BSIT student at the University of Immaculate Conception.
                People know me as the <i>"Purple girl"</i>  because I can't leave the house without bringing something purple or violet.
                I'm very outgoing, happy-go-lucky, and a daredevil.
